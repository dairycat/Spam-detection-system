# Spam-detection-system
Spam detection system
The following is the overall design of the six modules
(1) Processing of text data: It mainly includes the public dataset we obtained from Kaggle, which we divided into a test set (800, including 160 spam) and a training set (200, including 40 spam), and the ratio of normal emails to spam is 4:1.
(2) Creation of dictionaries: We traversed the text of spam and analyzed the text, in this module, the main work is to analyze the word frequency of each word, and count the word frequency of each word.
(3) Feature extraction: This module mainly extracts the optimal feature matrix for each email in the training set, and the feature matrix of each email includes the frequency of the selected highest-frequency AI (which will be found in the solution of the optimal size of the feature matrix) words.
(4) Solving the optimal size of the feature matrix: we set the dimension of the feature matrix as 1000~2000, we want to find the dimension that can make the F1 value of the algorithm the largest in these dimensions, so we test the effect of different dimensions, from 1000~2000, the step size is 100, to find the dimension that can make the optimal F1 value appear. The optimal F1 value is the average value of the F1 value under the optimal parameters of the six algorithms (also traversally solved). (We try to use the eight most common algorithms, but the random forest and gradient ascending tree algorithms are random algorithms, and even though we average the algorithm with multiple iterations, it still can't stabilize the optimal size, so we only use the six non-random algorithms)
(5) Basic algorithm module: This module uses the most common eight classification algorithms: naive Bayes, decision tree, KNN, SVC, logistic regression, random forest, AdaBoost, gradient boosting tree algorithm for classification, we output the accuracy rate, recall rate and F1 value in the test code, and the weighted average F1 value of the accuracy rate and recall rate is used as an index to measure the strength and weakness of the algorithm.
(6) Multi-algorithm combination module: We will use multiple algorithms to predict the result, such as similar and, or other operations (and it means that the email is judged as spam when both algorithms think that the email is spam, or it means that the email is judged as spam when one of the two algorithms thinks that the email is spam), or it is judged by three or four algorithms in a coordinated manner. At the same time, a way to find the optimal weight of each algorithm is proposed, that is, the method that can make the F1 value the highest.
